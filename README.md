## Overview

This project offers insights into Indian agricultural data from 1950 to 2020. It displays the crops with maximum and minimum production each year, and calculates average yield and cultivation area for each crop over the period. The results are shown in two tables:

1. **Maximum and Minimum Production by Year**
2. **Average Yield and Cultivation Area (1950-2020)**
